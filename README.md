# Spicy Chess / 30hr Hackathon project

- Not your regular game of chess... multiplayer in a sense that even the spectators can participate.
- Featuring a global chat you can use to find opponents and invite spectators, as well as a private room chat.
- Simply share your room name and someone will be able to connect to it to play against you or just watch and mess with your board.


## Game features

- **Every click matters**: Each click has a random chance of triggering a special effect. Both players and all spectators can trigger these multiple times.

**Effects**
- **The Flood:** All pieces run away to their starting location, killing any enemy pieces currently in their spot.
- **The Double Edged sword:** Kill the piece you just clicked on. Friendly fire is allowed. Keep that in mind when you click your own pieces to move.
- **The Ressurrection:** Bring a piece back to life. It doesn't matter who is clicking, if you or your enemy clicks on the initial spot of a piece, there is a chance to revive that piece.
- **The Plague:** All pieces have a 30% chance of instantly dying when this event is triggered.

<br>

**The only way to win** : Kill the enemy king. No more stalemates. No more checks or checkmates. No more warnings.
<br><br>
Oh and you can kill your own king by clicking on it too much.
